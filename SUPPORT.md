# Support and Help

Need help installing or using Meeting Media Manager (M³)? This document provides guidance on how to get help and support for the project.

## How to get help

Please seek support in the following ways:

1. :book: [**Read the M³ documentation**](https://sircharlo.github.io/meeting-media-manager/) to see if you can figure it out on your own. The documentation is the best place to start when you have questions about how to use M³. If you find a bug in the documentation, please open an issue or submit a pull request to fix it.

2. :bulb: **Search for answers and ask questions on GitHub.** This is the most appropriate place for debugging issues specific to your use of M³, or figuring out how to use M³ in a specific way. You can do so by searching through the existing [issues](https://github.com/sircharlo/meeting-media-manager/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and [discussions](https://github.com/sircharlo/meeting-media-manager/discussions?discussions_q=) to see if someone else has already asked the same question.

3. :memo: As a **last resort**, you may [open an issue](https://github.com/sircharlo/meeting-media-manager/issues/new/choose) to report a problem or [open a discussion](https://github.com/sircharlo/meeting-media-manager/discussions/new/choose) to ask a question. However, please clearly explain what you are trying to do, and list what you have already attempted to solve the problem.

## What NOT to do

Please **do not** do any of the following:

1. :x: Do not reach out to the author or contributor on social media by sending a direct message.

2. :x: Do not email the author or contributor.

3. :x: Do not open duplicate issues or litter an existing issue with +1's.

These are not appropriate avenues for seeking help or support with an open-source project. Please follow the guidelines in the previous section. Public questions get public answers, which benefits everyone in the community.
